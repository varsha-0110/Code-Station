# Testing Messaging and Drawing Sync Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat Message Issue
- **Problem**: Client was emitting `"SEND_MESSAGE"` but server was listening for `"send-message"`
- **Fix**: Updated `ChatInput.jsx` to use the correct `SocketEvent.SEND_MESSAGE` constant
- **Problem**: Server was broadcasting to all users including sender
- **Fix**: Changed to `socket.broadcast.to(roomId).emit()` to exclude sender

### 2. Tldraw Synchronization Issues
- **Problem**: Drawing editor was using custom SocketEvent object instead of imported constants
- **Fix**: Updated `DrawingEditor.jsx` to import and use `SocketEvent` from types
- **Problem**: Event name mismatch between client and server for drawing updates
- **Fix**: Aligned both client and server to use `"DRAWING_UPDATE"` event name
- **Problem**: Drawing sync logic was broken by over-simplification
- **Fix**: Reverted to original working implementation using `mergeRemoteChanges`

### 3. Server-side Improvements
- Added comprehensive debugging logs to track:
  - Room joining/disconnection
  - Message routing
  - Drawing updates
  - User management
- Improved error handling and validation
- Fixed drawing sync request routing

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd CodeStation/server
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Start the Client
```bash
cd CodeStation/client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Chat Messaging
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to the application in both
3. Join the same room with different usernames
4. Send messages from one user
5. Verify the other user receives the messages
6. Check browser console for debugging logs

### 4. Test Drawing Sync
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to the drawing editor in both
3. Draw something in one window
4. Verify the drawing appears in the other window
5. Test drawing from the second window
6. Check browser console for debugging logs

### 5. Run Automated Test (Optional)
```bash
cd CodeStation
npm install socket.io-client
node test-connection.js
```

## Debugging

### Client-side Logs
- Check browser console for:
  - Socket connection status
  - Message sending/receiving
  - Drawing sync events
  - Room joining status

### Server-side Logs
- Check server console for:
  - User join/disconnect events
  - Message routing
  - Room management
  - Drawing update broadcasts

## Expected Behavior

### Chat Messages
- ✅ User A sends message → User B receives it
- ✅ User B sends message → User A receives it
- ✅ Sender doesn't receive their own message
- ✅ Messages are properly formatted with username and timestamp

### Drawing Sync
- ✅ User A draws → User B sees the drawing
- ✅ User B draws → User A sees the drawing
- ✅ Drawing persists when switching between users
- ✅ No duplicate or conflicting updates

### Room Management
- ✅ Users can join the same room
- ✅ Users see when others join/leave
- ✅ Messages only go to users in the same room
- ✅ Drawing updates only go to users in the same room

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed WebSocket connections
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages or missing events
3. **Verify Room IDs**: Ensure both users are in the same room
4. **Check Socket IDs**: Verify socket connections are established
5. **Restart Server**: Sometimes socket state can become corrupted
